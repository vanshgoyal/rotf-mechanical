We have designed an autnomous restaurant service bot, which can perform various functions including handling of plates, waste cleaning and segregation, taking orders from costumers etc. 
Our Bot has 4 main components-

      1. Omni Chassis
      2. Plate Handling Mechanism
      3. Vacuum Cleaning Mechanism
      4. Dirt Cleaner
      
## Omni Chassis -

</p>

It is a three wheel omni drive that can easily move in any direction at a given instant. Wheels are attached to the base of omni chassis along with two rotatory encoders for providing feedback to the bot.


## Plate Handling Mechanism -

</p>

Our bot can store 3 food trays at a time. With our plate handling mechanism we can lift the plaltes from their position and place them on the table one by one. It consists of a rack and pinion mechanism for forward movement of the plate and a lead screw mechanism for upward and downward movement. It also contains spring tensed holders which can change their orientation when in need.

## Vacuum Cleaning Mechanism
<p align="center">

</p>

Our bot can segregate different kinds of waste using a ML model and we have constituted two vacuum systems to store the waste separately. Vaccum assembly consists of a fan box that will suck air from front and pass it at the back, along with dirt and waste collection box with a vacuum tube fitted at the front for waste collection.

## Dirt Cleaner
<p align="center">

</p>

Attached at the bottom of the bot this will revolve around its central axis and clean any dirt present on the floor while moving from one location to another.
