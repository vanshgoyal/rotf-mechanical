We have designed an autnomous restaurant service bot, which can perform various functions including handling of plates, waste cleaning and segregation, taking orders from costumers etc. 
Our Bot has 3 main components-

      1. Omni Chassis
      2. Plate Handling Mechanism
      3. Vacuum Cleaning Mechanism
      
## Omni Chassis -

It is a three wheel omni drive that can easily move in any direction at a given instant. Wheels are attached to the base of omni chassis along with two rotatory encoders for providing feedback to the bot.


## Plate Handling Mechanism -

Our bot can store 3 food trays at a time. With our plate handling mechanism we can lift the plaltes from their position and place them on the table one by one. It consists of a rack and pinion mechanism for forward movement of the plate and a lead screw mechanism for upward and downward movement. It also contains spring tensed holders which can change their orientation when in need.
