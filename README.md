We have designed an autnomous restaurant service bot, which can perform various functions including handling of plates, waste cleaning and segregation, taking orders from costumers etc. 
Our Bot has 3 main components-

      1. Omni Chassis
      2. Plate Handling Mechanism
      3. Vacuum Cleaning Mechanism

It is a three wheel omni drive that can easily move in any direction at a given instant. Wheels are attached to the base of omni chassis along with two rotatory encoders for providing feedback to the bot.
